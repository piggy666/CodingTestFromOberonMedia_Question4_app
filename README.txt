Operating System: Ubuntu 9.10
Ruby version: 1.8.7
Rails version: 2.2.3
Database: Sqlite3
Server: WEBrick

This directory includes a rails application named game and some sample pictures.

You could check the web app through running "ruby script/server" under the game
directory and browsing it on your internet browser.

You could also simply view the result by scanning the sample pictures.
 
I didn't use MySQL and Apache because this app is only a development version. 

In fact, I am totally a newbie to Ruby language and ROR. There is a lot for me
to learn about ROR. However, I have experienced on Python and Django. I believe
that I will master ROR very soon once I was involved in a total ROR working
environment.
